    <h2>February 17, 2017: "Home Team"</h2>
    <p>This past Friday night we pulled the Home Team card and we went to our FIRST Dubuque Fighting Saints hockey game. The date was great! We haven't been to a hockey game since either of us were kids, the date was a success! Although the home team didn't win, we had a memoriable date night and I think may have started a new tradition.</p>

    <h2>January 31, 2017: "Junior Date"</h2>
    <p>Tim surprised me with a Junior Date. 30 minutes before he picked me up, he told me he would be 15 minutes late, like true teenager fashion. This date was fantastic! He had a scavenger hunt at the Kennedy Mall, dinner at the Olive Garden and finished our awesome junior evening at Coldstone.</p>
