        <h1>Three ways to assign an "onmouseover" and "onmouseout" event to a h1 element.</h1>
        <p>1. Assign an "onmouseover" and "onmouseout" events to a h1 element with JavaScript listeners in the HTML.</p>

        <h1 id="demo" onmouseover="mouseOver()" onmouseout="mouseOut()">1. Mouse over me for red.</h1>

        <p>2. Use the HTML DOM to assign an "onmouseover" and "onmouseout" event to a h1 element.</p>

        <h1 id="demo-two">2. Mouse over me for blue.</h1>

        <p>3. Use the addEventListener() method to attach a "mouseover" and "mouseout" event to a h1 element in your JS script. Similar to example 1 but only in the JS script.</p>

        <h1 id="demo-three">3. Mouse over me for pink.</h1>

    <script src="script.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
