Exercise 9.1
Go on to the discussion board titled “Week 9 - Exercise 9.1” and create a new Thread. Make sure your title includes the phrase “Exercise 9.1”. You must post to the discussion board to receive full participation credit for the week.

Pick a site you use on a regular basis. Think about the functionality and user interface the site offers. Explain three specific ways in which you could use a JavaScript library to enhance the functionality of the site or improve its user interface.

Post the URL of the site along with your description (and explanatory screenshots if necessary) of how to implement a JS library to make improvements to your discussion board thread.
