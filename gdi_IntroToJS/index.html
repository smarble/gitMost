      ORIGINAL TEXT
      A fan brush is a fantastic piece of equipment. Use it. Make friends with it. Life is too short to be alone, too precious. Share it with a friend. In life you need colors. We'll lay all these little funky little things in there.
      Follow the lay of the land. It's most important. In your imagination you can go anywhere you want. Maybe there's a happy little waterfall happening over here.
      You got your heavy coat out yet? It's getting colder. Work on one thing at a time. Don't get carried away - we have plenty of time. You can create anything that makes you happy. Every highlight needs it's own personal shadow. Just make little strokes like that.
